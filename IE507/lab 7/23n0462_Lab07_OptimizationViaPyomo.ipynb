It is a powerful tool for modeling and solving a wide range of optimization problems, including linear programming, integer programming, mixed-integer programming, nonlinear programming, and more. Pyomo provides a flexible and intuitive way to define optimization models and solve them using a variety of solvers.  \n","\n","\n","## **Key Features of Pyomo**\n","\n","* **Model Components**: Pyomo allows you to define optimization models using high-level modeling components, such as variables, objectives, constraints, and sets. These components make it easy to formulate complex optimization problems.\n","* **Solver Interfaces**: Pyomo provides interfaces to various optimization solvers, both open-source and commercial. Some popular solvers that Pyomo can interface with include Gurobi, CPLEX, GLPK, and more. You can choose the solver that best suits your problem and availability.\n","* **Modeling Languages**: Pyomo supports both an algebraic modeling language (similar to mathematical notation) and a more programmatic modeling approach, giving users flexibility in how they define optimization models.\n","* **Extensions and Plugins**: Pyomo is highly extensible and allows users to create custom modeling components and extensions for specific problem domains. This makes it suitable for a wide range of applications.\n","* **Sensitivity Analysis**: Pyomo provides tools for performing sensitivity analysis, helping you understand how changes in problem parameters or constraints affect the optimal solution.\n","* **Parallel and Distributed Computing**: Pyomo can leverage parallel and distributed computing resources to solve large-scale optimization problems efficiently.\n","* **Integration with Data**: Pyomo can be integrated with data sources, databases, and external tools, making it suitable for optimization problems that involve dynamic or real-time data.\n","\n","For more details [Click Here](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"NxNFnXrNPYoB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Basic Optimization Problem**"],"metadata":{"id":"hppdHmhERSMJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Given below is an standard basic optimization problem which we will be solving using pyomo in this session.\n","\n","$$\\begin{equation}\n","\\min_{x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2} 3x_1 + 4x_2 + 5y_1 + 6y_2 \\\\\n","\\text{subject to} \\\\\n","\\hspace{5em} C_1: 6x_1 + 5y_2 \\leq 80 \\\\\n","\\hspace{11em} C_2: 4x_1 + 2x_2 + 10y_1 - 3y_2 \\geq 150 \\\\\n","\\hspace{5em} y_1 \\leq 100, y_2 \\geq 20 \\\\\n","\\end{equation}\n","$$\n","\n","Below is a standard procedure (but not limited) to solve above optimization problem using Pyomo. \\\\\n","**Note**: *Carefully read all the instructions and ask TA(s) in case of any doubt(s)*.
